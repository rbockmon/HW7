# HW7
Take the code that was written in class for K-means and make it work for a 3D data sets. Using the Spotify_ YouTube.csv data set, read in the following three columns: Liveness, Energy, Loudness. Using an elbow graph, find the optimal number of K and use that to visualize the data and groups based on that K. Graphs should be appropriately labeled with an x, y, and z axis along with a title and legend. Then write what your results might mean to you.

Then, run hierarchical clustering on the same three variables. Are there any? distinct groups. If so, how would you define each group? Graphs should be appropriately labeled. Then write what your results might mean to you.

Grading (Out of 100 points)
• 60 points: Cover what you did to update the code to work for 3D data and visualization along with what number of K you found to be optimal and the graphs showing the results of running K-means and what your results mean.
• 40 points: Report your findings for running Hierarchical clustering.
